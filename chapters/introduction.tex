\chapter*{Introduction}

The world nowadays is moving towards automation at an unprecedented rate. Almost every month, a new break-through is made in the path towards creating smart computer systems with the ability to learn and make decisions of their own. This progress does not only manifest itself in theoretical work and research papers, but also in real world applications such as the latest voice recognition software found in Amazons' Alexa, or the computer vision systems used by Teslas' autonomous cars. Most experts and speculators predict that soon enough, all of the aspects of ordinary life will be dependent upon the use of these artificially intelligent machines. Some are optimistic and consider this as a practical solution for a wide range of problems in various fields such as medicine, transportation, telecomunication, and even politics and economics. Others express fears that this technology may produce more problems that it would solve. In either case, the best way for academics to approach this is to explore this technology and develop a better understanding of the theory and methodology surrounding it.

This work is an attempt to bring a contribution to the field, and specifically the topic of deep convolutional neural networks, by developing a real world application to identify Algerian license plate numbers using image input of the cars. The techniques used are relatively outdated considering the high rate of innovation in deep learning. The two main research papers that this work is based upon came out in 2016 and 2018. The first one is a CNN model called Faster-RCNN and the other one is called YOLO, both these works showed practical state of the art results in the tasks of object detection and classification during the time they were released. This project also includes the creation of a lebeled data set of Algerian license plates, which is the first one ever of this kind. This data set will allow for other students or researchers to conduct similar works and will be used as a benchmark to track advancements in Algerian License plate detection.
