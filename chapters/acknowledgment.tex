\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent and the Most Merciful, all gratitude goes to Him before and after. For the strength and the preservation from all sickness. Secondly, we would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our teacher and supervisor Pr. Khouas who gave us the opportunity to fulfill this project and for his guidance and professionalism all along. We thank Dr. Andrew NG from coursera as well, who provided insights and expertise that greatly assisted the development of the project through his excellent courses and occasional tweets.
